### Problem Formulation
What are the factors, features and amenities that make an Airbnb listing more expensive?


### Explanatory Analysis.
We can analyze price concerning 4 different factors.

* Room Type

* Property Type

* Number of Bedrooms

* Amenities


### From the Analysis above, we can infer a few things.

1. The type of room for listing has a greater influence on the price. Most hosts list their entire property. The entire property is on the most expensive list.

2. Property type also influences the price. As mentioned in the previous one, listing the entire property fetches a higher price for the hosts.

3. The number of Bedrooms in the listing has a trend with the price of the listing. More the rooms, the higher the price for that listing.

4. We also observe that type of Amenities plays an important role in the listing price. Essentials Shampoo, Friendly Workspace, Parking, Laptop Friendly, Hair Dryer and    Wifi are the amenities most, expensive listings provide.
